# _Programming Language Suggester_

#### _Week 2 Independent Friday Assignment for Epicodus, 01.17.2020_

#### By _**Tiffany Siu**_

## Description

_This site is the Week 2 Friday independent assignment for Epicodus' full time Intro to Programming and C#/React course.  It has a quiz on which coding language someone should learn first and then calculates a result depending on the input provided.  The calculation for which result to show is from how many times an answer corresponding to a specific result is chosen.  If there was a tie between two results, a random result between them would be chosen and displayed._
